## Prototype Notice and Abuse Prevention Disclaimer

**This system is currently a prototype implementation.** While the core daemonized identity tree and Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) verification mechanisms are functional, certain trust policies are still under active development. 

### Trust Policies

When a user logs in through a child account, they do not maintain cryptographic control over any subordinate child nodes after a parent account is deleted or invalidated. The "Orphaned Cryptographic State" mechanism ensures that child nodes regain autonomy and cannot be held "hostage" by malicious child account operators. This protects the integrity of the identity tree and prevents abuse scenarios where compromised subtrees could persist unauthorized control.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Identity Management**: PhantomID allows users to manage their identities without relying on a central authority.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Our implementation uses ZKPs to verify identities without revealing sensitive information.
- **Robust Security**: The system employs state-of-the-art cryptographic techniques to safeguard user data.
- **User Autonomy**: Users maintain control over their identities and associated data, even in complex hierarchies.

## Prototype Limitations

While the system shows great promise, there are key limitations to be aware of:

- **Trust Policy Enforcement**: This is still being refined. Users should be cautious when using the system in its current state.
- **Network Synchronization**: Multiple daemon instances require additional testing for effective synchronization.
- **Post-Quantum Cryptographic Migration**: Plans are in place for future migration to post-quantum cryptographic algorithms.

## Installation

To install the PhantomID Network System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KevinLondono/phantomid-legacy.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd phantomid-legacy
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the system:
